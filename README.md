# Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The goal is to understand the dataset, identify patterns, handle missing values, and generate insights using statistical analysis and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains structured data related to sales and customer behavior. It includes features such as sales amount, quantity, category, region, and dates.

## Tasks Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Checked data types, missing values, and duplicates
- Performed descriptive statistical analysis
- Conducted exploratory analysis to identify trends and patterns
- Created visualizations to support insights

## Tools & Libraries
